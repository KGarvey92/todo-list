# todo-list
## Assignment
 Use modules and webpack to create a dynamic todo app that stores projects and tasks in localstorage.
* Keep app logic and DOM logic separate.
* Users must be able to edit and delete todo's and projects.

## Tools
* ESlint
* Webpack
* date-fns
* Localstorage

## Lessons Learned
* Building the entire app using modules really forced me to think about the differences and relationship between application logic and DOM logic.
* Learned how to store and pull objects from localstorage and how to use map to ensure that object methods could still be accessed.
* Practiced some CSS features I hadn't used before such as keyframes to make animations i.e te sidebar.
* I really committed to making this project responsive and accessible on different devices and resolutions.
